    "# Reading CSV data\n",
    "Tabular data is often saved in some sort of CSV like format. Sometimes the delimiter might be a tab or some other character instead of a comma. By convention, CSV files have a `.csv` extension (tab delimited files will often have a `.tsv` extension). CSV is such a common format that Python has a built in `csv` library. In addition, other Python libraries designed for data analysis (such as Pandas or Agate) often have their own functions for working with CSV files. In some cases, these functions are simply \"wrappers\" around Python's built in CSV functions.\n",

Now, whenever we use one of the data files to work along with the book examples, we'll copy the necessary file(s) from this master folder and put the copy into the same directory we are writing our code. By doing this we won't have to worry about file paths when we try to open the file in Python. Alternatively, you could make it your policy to always put the data files into a folder named `data` which lives in the folder housing your code. Then, your file path will always be `data/<filename>`. It's up to you. I urge you to be consistent.\n",
